# Server vs Client
sudo docker version

# Busybox
# BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable
sudo docker pull busybox

# The pull command fetches the busybox image from the Docker registry and saves it to our system. 
# You can use the docker images command to see a list of all images on your system.
sudo docker images

# Running Docker containers
# When you call run, the Docker client finds the image (busybox in this case), loads up the container and then runs a command in that container. 
# When we run docker run busybox, we didn't provide a command, so the container booted up, ran an empty command and then exited.
sudo docker run busybox

# Running BusyBox with command
# In this case, the Docker client dutifully ran the echo command in our busybox container and then exited it. 
# If you've noticed, all of that happened pretty quickly. Imagine booting up a virtual machine, running a command and then killing it.
sudo docker run busybox echo "Hello from BusyBox"

# Docker processes
# So what we see above is a list of all containers that we ran. Do notice that the STATUS column shows that these containers exited a few minutes ago
sudo docker ps -a

# Running the run command with the -it flags attaches us to an interactive tty in the container. 
# Now we can run as many commands in the container as we want. Take some time to run your favorite commands.
sudo docker run -it busybox sh

# Commands ot run inside container
echo 'Hello from inside'
ifconfig
top
exit

# Clean up dead containers
# We saw above that we can still see remnants of the container even after we've exited by running docker ps -a. 
# Throughout this tutorial, you'll run docker run multiple times and leaving stray containers will eat up disk space.
sudo docker ps -a
sudo docker container prune
sudo docker ps -a
